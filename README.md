Getting and Cleaning Data Project


Overview:

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis.A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Data description:

The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.


Code explaination:

The code combined training dataset and test dataset, and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.



The code was written based on the instruction of this assignment

  1)  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2)  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3)  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4)  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5)  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
